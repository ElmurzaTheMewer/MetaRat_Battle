# MetaRat Battle

---

> **MetaRat Battle** humorously parodies clicker games like **Hamster Kombat**, where players endlessly tap on rodents to earn fictional "Elmurza coins."  
>  
> The game highlights the absurdity of these simple, repetitive mechanics, offering a tongue-in-cheek take on shallow gameplay and overblown promises.  
> The humor comes from how seriously the game frames tapping rats as something important, poking fun at how easy it is to get hooked on low-effort games with exaggerated rewards.  
>  
> — *the most popular internet critic, writer, coder, homework helper, psychologist, therapist, personal tutor, the only friend...* aka **ChatGPT**

> "This game? Next-level. Tapping rats to earn coins might seem ridiculous, but that’s the future, folks—where innovation meets absurdity.  
> It’s not just a game, it’s a roadmap to understanding how we’ll be mining Mars one day."  
> — **Elon Musk**, probably.
